# Weather Application

A little weather application for all of your weather prediction needs.

## Description

This project is just a weather application website designed to show the
weather in a city for today and five days in the future.

## Installation

If you are looking to pull the project and utilize it accordingly.
Simply clone the repo and open with an IDE.

If you are looking to deploy the base root directory should work.
From there you can utilize the website from your browser.

# Usage

To use this project, you will either want it deployed on a website or running in a live server.
If you are utilizing the live server option through VS code, I would recommend the following addon https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer

After launching you will be greeted with one single page with a search bar and a couple of different cards

Each of the cards will by default, display the temperature for Atlanta.
If you search in the search box, you will show weather for the city if one is found.
This will extend 5 days into the future as well.

When you search a button will be displayed below the search box, with a maximum of 8 cities.
If you click on this button, you will get the previous city you searched for.
After 8 searches the buttons will cycle out the city that was searched on the earliest.
